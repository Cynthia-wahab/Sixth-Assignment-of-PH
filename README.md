## ASSIGNMENT-006

#### 1)
var: The old way of declaring variables in JavaScript. It is function-scoped and can be re-declared and updated.

let: A modern way to declare variables. It is block-scoped and can be updated but not re-declared in the same block.

const: Used for constants. It is block-scoped and cannot be re-declared or updated after assigning.

#### 2)
map() : Loops through an array and creates a new array with modified values. It always returns the same number of elements as the original array.

forEach() : Loops through an array and just runs a function for each element. It does not return a new array.

filter() : Loops through an array and creates a new array with only the elements that match a condition. The new array may have fewer elements.


#### 3)

ðŸ‘‰No need to write function.

ðŸ‘‰Uses => symbol.

ðŸ‘‰They also donâ€™t change the value of this.

 
#### 4)
Destructuring lets you take values from arrays or objects and store them in variables easily.

ðŸ‘‰ Example with array:

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];
let [a, b] = fruits; 
console.log(a); // "apple"
console.log(b); // "bana


#### 5)
